# Project 9: Page Tables

By Melissa Swearingen

---

For this assignment I simulated a page table on a simple computer. 

This simulation will allow me to start new (fake) processes that need a certain number of pages of physical memory, store and load data from virtual addresses per process, and so on. 

I am going to issue commands on the command line to do these things.
